# Deep-NSCLC Using InceptionV3 model. 
To provide the pathology department at JSS Hospitals with highly accurate model which can detect lung cancers and also predict the mutations.
The entire project is divided into 5 phases as follows:

## Data Acquisition:
Collecting whole slide images for Adenocarcinoma(LCAD) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma(LUSC) from TCGA using GDC Tool.
